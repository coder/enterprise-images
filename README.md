# Enterprise Example Images

These docs contain examples and guides for how to setup your images to utilize
the Multi Editor Support built into Coder Enterprise.

Each directory in [`images/`](./images) contains examples for how to setup your
images with different IDEs.

See our
[documentation at our Enterprise Hub](https://enterprise.coder.com/docs/multi-editor)
for additional information about supported editors and known issues.

## Image Minimums

All of the images provided in this repo include the following utilities to
ensure they work well with all of Coder Enterprise's features, and to provide a
solid out-of-the-box developer experience:

- git
- bash
- curl & wget
- htop
- man
- vim
- sudo
- python3 & pip3
- gcc & gcc-c++ & make

The one exception is the `minimal` image, which contains only bash, curl, git, and
sudo.

## Images on Docker Hub

Each of these images is also published to Docker Hub under the
`codercom/enterprise-[name]` repository. For example, `intellij` is available at
https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/enterprise-intellij. The tag is taken from the
file extension of the Dockerfile. For example, `intellij/Dockerfile.ubuntu` is
under the `ubuntu` tag.
